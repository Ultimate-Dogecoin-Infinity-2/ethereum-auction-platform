# Ethereum: Auction platform

Student project for blockchain fundamentals course.

## Planned functionalities
- A user should be able to create an auction by providing a starting price, deadline, and description of an item/service to be sold.
- For a given auction, users should be able to bid by locking their funds in the contract
- After the deadline, funds of the winner should be automatically transferred to the auction creator, and the rest of the locked funds should be returned to users.
