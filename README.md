# Ethereum: Auction platform

Student project for blockchain fundamentals course.

## Planned functionalities

-   A user should be able to create an auction by providing a starting price, deadline, and description of an item/service to be sold.
-   For a given auction, users should be able to bid by locking their funds in the contract
-   After the deadline, funds of the winner should be automatically transferred to the auction creator, and the rest of the locked funds should be returned to users.
